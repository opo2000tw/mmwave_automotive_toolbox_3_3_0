Overview of MMWAVE SDK Demo - 68xx HWA Version
===========

This is the mmWave SDK out-of-box demo lab for the TI AWR68xx EVM. Run this TI AWR68xx EVM out-of-box demo to view processed TI mmWave sensor data in configurable plots using the web-based mmWave Demo Visualizer.

**NOTE**: This version of the SDK out-of-box demo is for AWR68xx EVM but only uses the on-chip Hardware FFT acclerator (HWA) and does not utilize the on-chip c674x DSP. In this User Guide many of labels show xWR64xx but the demo is compatible with the AWR68xx device. The name xwr64xx is reserved for future devices without the on-chip c674x DSP core.

]]
  

### 3. Build the Lab

With the **mmwave_sdk_68xx_hwa**  project selected in **Project Explorer**, right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. 
  <img src="images/rebuild_project.png" width="400"/> 

{{y Selecting Rebuild instead of Build ensures that the project is always re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.}}

[[g! Successful Project Build
In the **Project Explorer** panel, navigate to and expand **mmwave_sdk_68xx_hwa &rarr; Debug** directory. On successfull build, the following files should appear in the **Debug** folder:
* xwr64xx_mmw_demo.bin  (this is the flashable binary used for deployment mode) 
* xwr64xx_mmw_mss.xer4f (this is the Cortex R4F binary used for CCS debug mode)
]]


[[r! Build Fails with Errors
If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the [prerequisites](#software_requirements) are installed as mentioned in the mmWave SDK release notes.

]]

### 4. Execute the Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* **Deployment mode**: In this mode, the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Using Uniflash, flash the **xwr64xx_mmw_demo.bin** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\mmwave_sdk_68xx_hwa\Debug\xwr64xx_mmw_demo.bin`  
	* The procedure to flash the EVM is the same as detailed in the [Flash the EVM](#flash_the_evm) section. 
* **Debug mode**: This mode is is used for downloading and running the executable (.xer4f) from CCS. This mode enables JTAG connection with CCS while lab is running; useful during development and debugging
     
  
[[+d Expand for help with Debug mode:
The CCS debug firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) needs to be flashed once on the EVM. 
* CCS Debug method is enabled by flashing the CCS Debug Firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) using the methods covered in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#1-flash-the-evm) section.
* Use the following image instead       

Image           | Location     | Comment

        <img src="images/common/load_program.png" width="600"/>
	
   * In the **Load Program** dialog, press the **Browse Project** button .
   * Select **xwr64xx_mmw_mss.xer4f** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\mmwave_sdk_68xx_hwa\Debug\xwr64xx_mmw_mss.xer4f` and press **Ok**.
    * Press **Ok** again in the **Load Program** dialog.
	
  
  * Run the binary
    * Select **Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug probe/Cortex_R4_0**, press the **Run/Resume** button <img src="images/common/run_resume_icon.png" width="30"/>
    * The program should start executing and generate console output as shown.
	
        <img src="images/ccsdebug_console.png" width="600"/>
 
    
	[[g! Successful Run Binary
	If binary is running correctly, the Console will include the “CLI is operational” message which indicates that the program is ready and waiting for the sensor configuration.
	]]
+]]

After running the lab using either method, the demo firmware should be executing on the EVM and waiting for sensor configuration. After this point, please follow the instructions provided in the [Quickstart](#run_the_lab) section to bring-up the mmWave Demo Visualizer for sending the configuration and visualizing the results.
