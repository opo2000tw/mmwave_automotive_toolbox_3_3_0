# Overview

This lab demonstrates the use of TI 60GHz mmWave sensors for occupancy detection 
(including both adults and babies) for a single row of seats using the xWR6443 
sensor module mounted in a vehicle. A 3D point cloud (range-azimuth-elevation) is
produced by generating range-azimuth and azimuth-elevation heatmaps along with
CFAR. Zone mapping uses cuboid volumes and state machine algorithms run to 
produce zone occupancy decisions in the accompanying MATLAB visualizer.

**NOTE**: This demo is compatible with both the xWR6443 and xWR6843, as it only
uses the on-chip Hardware FFT acclerator (HWA) and does not utilize the on-chip
c674x DSP. While this demo is intended for the xWR6443 device, a xWR6843 device
can be used for emulation.

        Before continuing with this lab, users should first run the out of box demo for the EVM.
        This will enable users to gain familiarity with the sensor's capabilities as well as the various tools used across all labs in the mmWave Automotive Toolbox.
        ]]

    
    ## Calibration
    
        [[y! Calibrating the demo configuration for your Antenna Module

        In order to get the best detection performance, users should run the Out of Box Demo
        Range Bias and Rx Channel Gain/Phase Measurement and Compensation procedure to
        get the calibration coefficients for their Antenna Module and replace the
        default coefficients in the configuration file
        `<mmwave_automotive_toolbox_install_dir>\labs\incabinsensing\single_row_occupancy\chirp_configs\incabin_single_row.cfg`
        with the values returned by the calibration procedure.

        The following command in the chirp configuration file needs to be updated with the calibrated values.

        **compRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase `0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0`** (This is the default command)

        The updated command will look similar to the following (but with different values)

        **compRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase `0.1044657 -0.11493 0.79419 -0.13123 -0.83478 -0.08484 -0.77560 0.04535 0.72226 0.09491 0.81415 -0.41129 -0.69214 -0.27069 -0.64630 0.20770 0.63818 0.67627 0.69116 -0.90146 -0.43289 -0.81061 -0.48209 0.72995 0.50214`**

    ## 4. Mount EVM and Create Test Environment
        The mounting of the device for this lab is highly dependent on the desired usecase. In order to support this,
        the GUI and config file for this lab include parameters that can be modified in order to support different
        mount locations and angles. The parameters to look at are the following:
        * **Sensor Mounting Height** from the GUI- Height from the sensor to the floor of the vehicle in meters
        * **Sensor Elevation Tilt** from the GUI- Angle that the EVM is mounted at in degrees. 0 is vertical, -90 is 
            aimed straight down, and positive 90 is aimed straight up
        * **Sensor Azimuth Tilt** from the GUI- Angle that the EVM is mounted at in degrees. 0 is vertical, -90 is 
            aimed left, and positive 90 is aimed right
        * **cuboidDef** in the .cfg file- These are used to define the zones which will be used for occupancy detection. 
            It is crucial to define these zones based on their distances **relative** to the sensor. By changing their 
            postioning, you can account for the changed position of the sensor. If you mount the device facing the rear 
            of the vehicle, your coordinate system would look as follows:
        <img src="images/coordinate_transform.jpg" width="500" class="img-responsive"/>

        When mounting, it is crucial to keep the field of view(FOV) of the antenna in mind. The FOV can 
        be found in the user's guide for your particular EVM. For this demo, the FOV of the 6843ISK antenna is shown in the
        plot as dashed lines. If you do not plan the sensor mounting with this FOV in mind, the sensor may not be able to detect
        all of the space that is defined in the zones.

        For ease of testing and safety, it is recommended to use appropriately long enough cables so that you can fasten them out of the way to
        facilitate entering and exiting the vehicle without getting tangled in them.  It is also recommended to have the test operator running
        the GUI a few feet away from the vehicle to avoid contaminating the results.

        It is also possible to test in a lab environment by mounting the EVM on a camera tripod, but the results will not be the same due
        to the reflective surfaces inside a vehicle. In this situation, you will want to make the lab setup match the corresponding 
        incabin setup as much as possible to ensure that cuboid/zone placements are accurate.


    ## 5. Launch the Visualizer
        [[y! MATLAB Runtime Version R2017a (9.2)

        3. Add the mounting height (relative to the vehicle floor) and the angles at which the sensor is mounted to their respective fields under **Sensor Infomation**.
        4. Click **Setup Complete** to start the visualizer.
        5. The visualizer window will appear after several seconds and should start showing the point cloud and occupancy decisions in the main panel.


    ## 7. Understand the Visualizer
        The visualizer window is composed of a few components that can be seen in the
        image below.

        * The three-dimensional graph which occupies the majority of the
            visualizer.
            * Includes all cuboids, colored based on which zone that they are a part of.
            * The incoming point cloud from the device.
        * The zone status, located in the top right, shows the current occupancy
            status for each zone.
        * The current statistics, located in the top left, shows important data such
            as the frame number, number of points currently in the point cloud, and
            number of frames in the buffer.
        * The view selection, located in the bottom left, allows the user to change
            to any of the two-dimensional views.

# Algorithm Overview

    This demo can be viewed as two pieces: the device running the radar code and
    the host running the visualizer. The device code is based on the Out of Box 
    demo for the xWR6443, and additional information related to that part of the 
    algorithm can be viewed under
    `<mmWave_sdk_install_dir>\packages\ti\demo\xwr64xx\mmw\docs\doxygen\html\index.html`.
    The high level flow is described here: 
    <img src="images/alg_block.png" width="800"/>

    Once this data has been passed to the host machine running the 
    visualizer, the Occupancy Detection State Machine will then determine the 
    occupancy status for each zone using the number of points located in each 
    zone along with their SNR values. The state machine will make this decision 
    based on the parameters passed in by the `occStateMach` CLI command.

# Tuning
    
    The key items to focus on for tuning are as follows:
        * **Proper [mounting](#4-mount-evm-and-create-test-environment)** - 
            Ensure that all FOV and resolution constaints from the device are
            accounted for.
        * **Accurate [zone definition](#zone-definition)** - Ensuring the zones
            align with the physical space of the vehicle. This is described in
            further detail in the section below.
        * **occStateMach** - All the parameters in the occStateMach affect how 
            the occupancy state machine moves between states. They may need 
            to be adjusted depending on the number of points and their SNR 
            that is observed in the specific environment. This parameter is
            further defined in the section below.
        * **txOutPower in profileCfg** - increasing this value should help to 
            reduce reflections, but will likely reduce the effectiveness
            of point detection.
        * **threshold scale in cfarCfg** - Increasing this value will reduce the 
                number of detected points by changing the threshold required
                and can be useful to modify if there are too many or too foo
                points detected.    

    ## Demo-Specific Configuration File Parameters

        In addition to the standard mmWave chirp configuration CLI commands 
        (please refer to the [SDK's user guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/ra-processors/esd/MMWAVE-SDK/latest/exports/mmwave_sdk_user_guide.pdf) 
        for these commands), there are some additional commands that are specific to this demo:


        Command         | Parameters (in command line order)
        ----------------|------------
        occStateMach    | threshold 1: number of detected points in a zone to enter the occupied state
                        | threshold 1: average SNR of detected points in a zone to enter the occupied state
                        | threshold 2: number of detected points in a zone to enter the occupied state
                        | threshold 2: average SNR of detected points in a zone to enter the occupied state
                        | number of detected points in a zone to remain in the occupied state
                        | average SNR of detected points in a zone to remain in the occupied state
                        | number of frames with less than ceiling points (see next parameter) to hold occupied state before dropping
                        | ceiling points (max points) in a zone during "hold" frames.
                        | average SNR in a zone to declare overload condition (excessive movement). Causes state machine to freeze all zones in that row.
        cuboidDef       | parent zone number (1 based)
                        | cuboid number within the zone (also 1 based). min = 1, max = 3 per zone
                        | min X
                        | max X
                        | min Z
                        | max Z
                        | min Y (Should not be negative)
                        | max Y (Should not be greater than the sensor height listed in GUI)
                        | (Note: to define a NULL zone, define it with a single cuboidDef command setting all X,Y,Z values to 0.0)


    ## Zone Definition

        In order to classify the occupancy of each seat while using only a point 
        cloud, a method to define each seat as a volume is utilized. This is accomplished by defining
        a number of *cuboids*, which are simply rectangular volumes. Then each 
        seat can be defined as a *zone*, where a zone is composed of multiple
        (in this case three) cuboids. These zones will approximate the space where 
        to look for occupants.

        In this demo, up to three cuboids can be assigned per zone. A detected point in the
        point cloud residing any of these cuboids will be included in the
        calculations for determining occupancy. If the zone is a cargo area, you may
        need to define only one cuboid to approximate the space. For normal vehicle
        seats, it may be important to check the foot well areas for children and pets. 
        In this case, there are three zones defined

            * Cuboid 1: Head and chest area
            * Cuboid 2: Lap area
            * Cuboid 3: Foot well

        Zones may overlap or be disjoint. The only check for zone inclusion is that a
        detected point is within the boundaries of at least one cuboid. It is therefore
        not a good idea to define Zone 1 and Zone 2 (for example) with cuboids that
        overlap, as this will reduce performance. Also, there is no performance
        difference (in terms of MIPs) if cuboids are large or small. The boundary
        checks are the same in either case. It is **highly recommended** to leave space in
        between zones, since detection points from a zone will spread out from the
        occupant's actual position, more as the amount of occupant movement increases.

        Cuboids are defined by the **cuboidDef** CLI command in the chirp configuration
        file. For more information on this command, refer to the
        [previous section](#demo-specific-configuration-file-parameters).
        Here is a sample definition of three zones:

        ```java
        % zone 1 (2nd row driver side) cuboids
        cuboidDef 1 1   0.15 0.75   0.3 1.0    0.85 1.3
        cuboidDef 1 2   0.15 0.75   0.1 1.0    0.5  0.85
        cuboidDef 1 3   0.15 0.75   0.1 0.5    0.0  0.5
        % zone 2 (2nd row middle) cuboids
        cuboidDef 2 1  -0.12 0.12   0.3 1.0    0.85 1.3
        cuboidDef 2 2  -0.12 0.12   0.1 1.0    0.5  0.85
        cuboidDef 2 3  -0.12 0.12   0.1 0.5    0.0  0.5
        % zone 3 (2nd row passenger side) cuboids
        cuboidDef 3 1  -0.75 -0.2   0.3 1.0    0.85 1.3
        cuboidDef 3 2  -0.75 -0.2   0.1 1.0    0.5  0.85
        cuboidDef 3 3  -0.75 -0.2   0.1 0.5    0.0  0.5
        ```**Example Zone/Cuboid CLI Definitions**

        To define a NULL zone, simply define a zone with a single cuboid, and set all
        parameters to zero. This makes it impossible for the zone assignment function to
            map any points to the zone, and the zone will stay silent.

        ```java
        % zone 4 (NULL zone)
        cuboidDef 4 1   0.0 0.0  0.0 0.0  0.0 0.0
        ```**Example NULL Zone Definition**

        [[r! Error during Import to IDE
          If an error occurs, check that the software dependencies listed above 
          have been installed. Errors will occur if necessary files are not 
          installed in the correct location for importing.
        ]]


    ## 3. Build the Lab

        1. Select the **single_row_occupancy_6443** in **Project Explorer** 
            so that it is highlighted. Right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. The project will then build.
        2. On successful build, the following should appear:
           * In `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\single_row_occupancy_6443 `&rarr;` Debug`
             * **single_row_occupancy_6443.xer4f** (this is the Cortex R4F binary used for CCS debug mode)
             * **single_row_occupancy_6443.bin** (this is the flashable binary used for deployment mode)

        {{y Selecting Rebuild instead of Build ensures that the project is always
        re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build 
        failed with errors.}}

        [[r! Build Fails with Errors
        If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the software 
        requirements are installed as listed above and in the mmWave SDK release
        notes.
        ]]

        [[b! Note
        As mentioned in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section, pre-built binary 
        files, both debug and deployment binaries are provided in the 
        pre-compiled directory of the lab.
        ]]


    ## 4. Execute the Lab

        There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
        * **Deployment mode**: the EVM boots from flash and starts 
            running the bin image at power-up
            * Using Uniflash, flash the **single_row_occupancy_6443.bin** 
            found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\single_row_occupancy_6443\Debug`
            * The same procedure for flashing can be used as detailed in the 
            [Flash the EVM](#2-flash-the-evm-using-uniflash) section.
        * **Debug mode**: This mode is used for downloading and running the 
            executable from CCS. This mode enables JTAG connection with CCS 
            while the lab is running and is useful during development and debugging.
            * Follow the [CCS Debug Mode Guide](../../../../mmwave_sdk_ccs_projects/common/docs/software_setup/using_ccs_debug.html)

        
        After executing the lab using either method, launch the visualizer and 
        proceed as described under [Quickstart](#quickstart)
